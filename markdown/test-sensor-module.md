# Test Sensor Module (Markdown)

To validate the Sensor Module's ability to accurately acquire, preprocess, and transmit data to the software subsystem.

## Steps
1. Initialization:
    * Power on the device and ensure the Sensor Module is operational.
    * Connect the device to a data simulator set to generate a normal signal.
2. Data Acquisition:
    * Start the data simulator and begin data acquisition with the Sensor Module.
    * Ensure the sampling rate is set to at least 250 samples per second.
3. Preprocessing:
    * Verify that the Sensor Module is applying noise reduction and baseline correction to the raw data.
    * Monitor the output data to ensure it is free from noise and artifacts.
4. Data Transmission:
    * Check that the preprocessed data is being transmitted to the Software Subsystem via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
    * Confirm that the data transmission is secure and encrypted.
5. Error Handling:
    * Simulate a data transmission error by introducing a disruption in the BLE connection.
    * Verify that the Sensor Module detects the error and retransmits the data successfully.

## Expected Behavior
1. Initialization:
    * The device and Sensor Module power on and initialize correctly.
    * The data simulator connects successfully to the device.
2. Data Acquisition:
    * The Sensor Module acquires data at the specified sampling rate of at least 250 samples per second.
    * The acquired data accurately represents the normal signal generated by the simulator.
3. Preprocessing:
    * The Sensor Module applies effective noise reduction and baseline correction.
    * The output data is free from noise and artifacts.
4. Data Transmission:
    * The preprocessed data is transmitted to the Software Subsystem without delay.
    * Data transmission is secure and encrypted using AES-256 encryption.
5. Error Handling:
    * The Sensor Module detects the transmission error and successfully retransmits the data after the disruption is resolved.
    * No data loss occurs during the error and retransmission process.
